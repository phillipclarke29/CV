## Philip Clarke

I have spent the last 10 years using PHP based technologies to build, develop and sell some wonderful products. I love taking ideas and turning them into exciting businesses and want to use the latest technologies to do it all over again.  Looking to build on my coding adventures at Makers Academy and to grow my junior developer skills whilst creating something fantastic.
