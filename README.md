## Philip Clarke

I get my tech kicks by taking ideas and turning them into exciting businesses.  Over the last 10 years, I have built and sold innovative web products for companies in both private and public sectors across the UK.  Parents and carers still use my software across the UK to access professional development, training and support when working with vulnerable children.  

Continuing on after my coding adventure at Maker's Academy, I want to use the latest technology to do it all over again start as a junior developer and working my way back up. I love learning and particularly enjoy turning great ideas and good code into income.  In my perfect world I would be having fun, working hard, building something beautiful and cutting edge for a global market.
