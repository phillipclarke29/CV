## Philip Clarke

I have spent the last 10 years using PHP based technologies to build, develop and sell innovative web products to companies, charities and government departments across the UK. I get my tech kicks by taking ideas and turning them into exciting businesses and now want to use the latest technologies to do it all over again.  I would like to build on my coding adventures at Makers Academy, grow my junior developer skills, and help create something fantastic, new and exciting.
