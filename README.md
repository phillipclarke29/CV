## Philip Clarke

Over the last 10 years, I have built and sold innovative web products to both the private and public sectors and I know of no better buzz than successfully developing and selling a new product. I am proud that parents and carers across the UK still use my software to access professional development, training and support when working with vulnerable children.  

I have extensive experience of starting, developing and growing businesses, managing budgets and staff and working at a senior level - but I fell in love with coding.  I want to continue on after my coding adventure at Makers Academy and use the latest technology to do it all over again, starting as a junior developer and working my way back up. I love learning and particularly enjoy working in pairs and as part of a team to turn great ideas and good code into income.  

In my perfect world I would be having fun, working hard, building something beautiful and cutting edge for a global market - something like our globaltrackit project - but with funding.



#### Software Development

- Using Elgg initially, then Drupal and PHP, I successfully built and sold micro networking products for local authorities to facilitate knowledge sharing communities for vulnerable groups across the UK.
- Designed, implemented, hosted and supported global case management software for the European Gaucher Alliance which tracks requests for charitable access treatment for children and adults across the world with Gaucher disease.
- Built and sold an SMS school bus alert system based on the Essendex API to support parents of disabled children.
- Created an MVP HR goal sharing application for Amelore Ltd.


#### IT entrepreneur

- 10 years building tech businesses, some successful, some unsuccessful.
- Built and sold products for clients from start ups, charities to local government, including North Lanarkshire Council Haringey Council, Norfolk County Council, Gaucher Association and Amelore Ltd.
- Ran my own IT company with turn over of up to £200,000 a year.
- Led the business development of CareZone, an early silicon roundabout start up delivering secure web service for vulnerable children. http://tinyurl.com/zjuaymy


#### Database Marketing

- 15 years marketing database management for charities including Kids Company, RSPB, Kew Gardens and IFAW.
- Managed a direct mail marketing team of 7 that grew major donor income by 100% to £9 million in two years.
- Built a global marketing team based of 3 in three continents working to support international wildlife conservation work.
- Set up marketing and fundraising databases for other charities.
