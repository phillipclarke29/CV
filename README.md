## Philip Clarke

Over the last 20 years, I have built and sold innovative IT solutions to both the private and public sectors and I know of no better buzz than successfully developing and selling a new product or online service.

I have extensive experience of starting, developing and growing businesses, managing budgets and staff and working at a senior level.  I have recruited, built and managed successful "stripy" teams, bringing together a variety of contractors, developers, researchers, technical authors and engineers to create focussed, agile teams.

In my perfect world I would be having fun, working hard, building something beautiful and cutting edge for a global market.



#### Software Development

- Using Elgg initially, then Drupal and PHP, I successfully built and sold secure networking products for local authorities to facilitate knowledge sharing communities for vulnerable groups across the UK.
- Designed, implemented, hosted and supported global case management software for the European Gaucher Alliance which tracks requests for charitable access treatment for children and adults across the world with Gaucher disease.
- Built and sold an SMS school bus alert system based on the Essendex API to support parents of disabled children.
- Created an MVP HR goal sharing application for Amelore Ltd.
- Recruited and led a team of 15 developers building a multi - million pound cutting edge online service for a government department.


#### IT entrepreneur

- 10 years building tech businesses, some successful, some unsuccessful.
- Built and sold products for clients from start ups, charities to local government, including North Lanarkshire Council Haringey Council, Norfolk County Council, Gaucher Association and Amelore Ltd.
- Ran my own IT company with turn over of up to £200,000 a year.
- Led the business development of CareZone, an early silicon roundabout start up delivering secure web service for vulnerable children. http://tinyurl.com/zjuaymy


#### Database Marketing

- 15 years database engineering for charities including Kids Company, RSPB, Kew Gardens and IFAW.
- Managed a direct mail team of 7 practitioners and engineers that grew major donor income by 100% to £9 million in two years.
- Built a global marketing team based of 3 in three continents working to support international wildlife conservation work.
- Set up marketing and fundraising databases for other charities.
