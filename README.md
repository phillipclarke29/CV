## Philip Clarke

I get my tech kicks by taking ideas and turning them into exciting businesses.  Over the last 10 years, I have built and sold innovative web products for companies in both private and public sectors across the UK.  Continuing my coding adventure at Maker's Academy, I want to use the latest technology to do it all over again. 

Currently I am looking for full time opportunity to grow as a junior developer, and help create exciting new softwares.  I love learning new technologies and particularly enjoy turning great ideas and good code into profit.  In my perfect world, I would be helping to build something beautiful for a global market.

<!-- A&E : to be more explicit of what exactly you are looking for, eg. a full time / part time junior developer position.  Be god to elaborate with your vision of creating something fantastic, new and exciting??) -->
